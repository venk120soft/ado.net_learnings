1.What is ADO.NET?
  * It is a object oriented technology given by the Microsoft.

3.what is the difference between connection oriented architecture and disconnected architecture?
            connection oriented                         disconnected
            -------------------                      -------------------   (a)the application with establish          (a)the required data will befetched
   connection with database server            in tothe datasetandtheconnection
   and it will be kept open and until         will be closed. 
   task has been completed
                                           
 (b)for every operation of the database     (b)the required data manipulatins 
   we need to communicate with database      will be  done on the tables in to 
   server,so that traffic to the             the dataset then changes will be                                               update back to the database    
   database server will be increased         at once,so that traffic the                                                    database server can be reduced
         
         (c)parallel transactions will be easy      (c)parallel transactions will be difficult
         
         (d)fetching the data will be fast          (d)fetching the data will be slow

         (e)no memory management is required        (e)memory management is required for the
                                                       dataset.
